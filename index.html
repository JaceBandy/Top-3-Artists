            <div class="box"><h2>Zach Bryan</h2>
            <p>
             I love his sound and story development within his songs. Also, each song has a uniqueness to it that others fail to do.  
            </p>

        <div class="box"><h2>50 Cent</h2>
        <p>
            He just has some undeniable hits and you can never go wrong with him when in the gym.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box"><h2>Live</h2>
        <p>
            I like the airy/eery feel of their songs. Another good gym or late night drive artist.
